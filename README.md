# AI for Mental Health: A Survey of Models Leveraging Textual and Behavioral Data

This repository contains the collection of research papers and references used for the literature survey titled:

> **"AI for Mental Health: A Survey of Models Leveraging Textual and Behavioral Data"**

## 🧠 Objective

The purpose of this repository is to consolidate relevant academic research and industrial papers that explore how Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP) and behavioral analysis, is used for mental health detection and support. The survey will analyze models, datasets, ethical concerns, and the technological landscape surrounding AI-based mental health tools.

## 📂 Structure of the Repository

```
📁 references/             # Contains the downloaded research papers (PDFs)
📄 README.md               # This file
📄 reference_list.md       # Annotated bibliography and notes on each paper
```

## 🔍 Focus Areas

This literature survey focuses on (but is not limited to) the following dimensions:

- **NLP models** for detecting mental health conditions from text (social media posts, journal entries, chat logs)
- **Behavioral analysis** using wearable devices, app usage, and passive data
- **Multimodal approaches** combining text, audio, and physiological data
- **Ethical challenges** like privacy, data anonymization, and bias
- **Benchmark datasets** and evaluation metrics
- **Clinical validation** and real-world applications

## 📚 How to Use This Repository

- Navigate to the `references/` folder to access the collected research papers.
- The `reference_list.md` file contains short descriptions and takeaways for each paper, helping readers quickly identify relevant studies.
- This repository is a living document. New papers will be added as the research progresses.

## ✍️ Intended Audience

This work is aimed at:

- Researchers and students interested in **AI for healthcare**, **computational psychiatry**, or **NLP in social good**.
- Mental health professionals exploring **AI-assisted tools** for diagnosis or monitoring.
- Developers of ethical and responsible **AI-driven mental health applications**.

## 🛡️ Ethical Considerations

Mental health is a sensitive domain. All research referred to in this project will be assessed critically with respect to:

- Transparency in data collection
- Informed consent and privacy preservation
- Minimization of algorithmic bias
- Clinical safety and real-world usability
